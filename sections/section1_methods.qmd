## Methods

This section details the methodological approach used in this project. It covers the data collection procedure, analytical techniques, and implementation details.

### Data Collection

The data for this study was collected from various sources, including:

- Source 1: Description of the data source
- Source 2: Description of the data source
- Source 3: Description of the data source

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the dataset:

|  Variable  |  Description  |  Unit  |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Variable 1 | Description of variable 1 | units |
| Variable 2 | Description of variable 2 | units |
| Variable 3 | Description of variable 3 | units |

### Implementation

The implementation was done using Python, with the following key libraries:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```

The model was implemented as follows:

```{python}
#| eval: false
def build_model(X_train, y_train):
    """
    Build and train the regression model.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    X_train : DataFrame
        Training feature set
    y_train : Series
        Target variable
        
    Returns:
    --------
    model : LinearRegression
        Trained regression model
    """
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

# Example usage
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = build_model(X_train, y_train)
```

### Validation

To validate the model's performance, we used the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)

The validation process involved k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness of the results.

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$ {#eq-mse}

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
$$ {#eq-rmse}

$$
\text{R}^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$ {#eq-r2}
