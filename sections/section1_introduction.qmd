## Introduction

This section introduces the main concepts and objectives of the project. It provides an overview of the problem statement, methodology, and expected outcomes.

### Background

The background subsection provides context for the project, including relevant literature review and theoretical foundations. It helps the reader understand the significance of the work.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement clearly articulates the specific issue that the project aims to address. It should be concise and well-defined.

### Mathematical Formulation

The mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows:

|  |  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| $x_i$ | decision variable 1 |
| $y_i$ | decision variable 2 |
| $p_i$ | parameter 1 |
| $i$ | index, $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ |

The objective function is defined as: 

$$
\text{Minimize} \quad z\left(\mathbf{x, y}\right) \quad=\quad \sum_{i = 1}^{n} p_i x_i
$$ {#eq-obj-func}

Subject to the following constraints:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \quad\le\quad C
$$ {#eq-constr-1}

$$
x_i \ge 0 \qquad\forall i \in \{1, \ldots n\}
$$ {#eq-constr-2}
