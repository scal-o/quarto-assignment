# Gemini Project Instructions

This project uses Quarto to create a document with text and Python code.

## Project Structure

-   `index.qmd`: The main Quarto file that merges all the sections.
-   `sections/`: This directory contains the individual problem solutions.
    -   `problem_x.qmd`: Each file solves a specific problem from the problem set.
-   `data/`: Contains all the datasets used in the project.
-   `graphics/`: Stores any figures or plots generated by the code.
-   `_quarto.yml`: Quarto project configuration file.
-   `GEMINI.md`: This file, containing project instructions.

## Workflow

1.  For each problem `x` from the problem set, create a corresponding `sections/problem_x.qmd` file.
2.  Write the solution, including text explanations and Python code blocks, within the respective `.qmd` file.
3.  Ensure that any data used is placed in the `data/` directory and accessed from there.
4.  Save any generated figures or plots to the `graphics/` directory.
5.  The `index.qmd` file will be used to assemble the final document from the individual `problem_x.qmd` files.

## Python Guidelines

-   Use `seaborn` for plots, preferring the objects interface.
-   Use the `seaborn.set_theme(style="whitegrid")` preset for all plots.
-   Keep code simple and minimize imported packages. Default to `pandas`, `numpy`, and `sklearn`.
-   Quarto code cells are defined by the name of the language enclosed in `{}` parentheses.

## Library Information

- When you need information about a library, use the `context7 mcp server` to retrieve it.
